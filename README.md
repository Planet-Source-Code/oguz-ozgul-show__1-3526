### Description

These graphical example generates 1 to 4 explosions on the screen.

Each explosion has 1 to 64 pieces.

Each piece has 1 to 9 pixels.

Every piece has its own direction (clockwise or not), and has its own rotating frequency. ALL THE PIECES ROTATING!

NO API FUNCTION CALLS, JUST the PSET!!!

It is a really first project of my own with VB5.

Enjoy.
